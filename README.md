# Side-to-side Communication

This is a code which provides a **side-to-side** communication. It won't record your messages. And also it is very **easy** to use.

## Enviorment setup

- [CommunicationCore](https://github.com/ILikeLayla/CommunicationCore)(You need to put it into your dictionary.)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/)(optional)
- [Even Better TOML](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/)(optional)

## Note

- Before you use it, you should prepare a font file and name it as "font.tff" and put it into the font dic. Here I also provide one.
